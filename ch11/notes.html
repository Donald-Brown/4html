  <h1>Images</h1>
  <h2>Image Types</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>JPEG</h3>
      <p>
        Typically used for photographs and scanned images because it uses a type of compres-sion that can display complex images with a small file size. A JPEG file can represent millions of colors, loses information when compressed, and doesn’t support transparency.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>GIF</h3>
      <p>
        Typically used for logos, small illustrations such as clip art, and animated images. A GIF file can represent up to 256 colors, doesn’t lose information when compressed, and supports transparency on a single color.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>PNG</h3>
      <p>
        Typically used as a replacement for still GIF images. Compressed PNG files are typi-cally smaller than GIF compressed files, although no information is lost. This format can represent millions of colors and supports transparency on multiple colors. PNG files are supported by all modern browsers, as well as mobile devices.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>WebP</h3>
      <p>
        A modern format that is used as a replacement for PNG and JPEG files. When com-pressed with no loss of information, WebP files are 26% smaller than PNG files. When compressed with loss of information, WebP files are 25 to 34% smaller than JPEG files. Both lossless and lossy formats support transparency.
