  <h2>Teach your students using the books the professionals use</h2>
  <p>
    Although our books are written for professional programmers who need to master new job skills, there have always been instructors teaching job-oriented curricula who&rsquo;ve adopted our books. For example, our books are used:
  </p>
  <img src="images/students.jpg" alt="teacher and students" width="192" height="128" longdesc="A teacher looking over the work of four students">
  <ul>
    <li>in college and university MIS programs that focus on providing students with practical, real-world experience</li>
    <li>by technical institutes and community colleges that focus on the skills that employers are looking for</li>
    <li>in Continuing Ed and Extension programs where the students are professionals who are expanding their skills</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="last">
    So if your program fits one of those profiles, please take a look at our books. I&rsquo;m confident you&rsquo;ll discover a new level of structure, clarity, and relevance that will benefit you and your students.
